Installation of GRIP scripts on the DEX hardware.


Unzip the distribution file to extract:

	- a tar archive including the script files (xxxScripts.tar)
	- a tar archive including the picture files (xxxPictures.tar)
	- an MD5 file containing the checksums for the above archives
	- a release note (*.txt)
	- this installation report

Extract the scripts by double-clicking xxxScripts.tar:

	- a directory will be created containing the full set of scripts (*.dex)
	- you can check the integrity of the scripts by double-clicking Scripts.md5

Extract the pictures by double clicking xxxPictures.tar:

	- a directory will be created containing the full set of scripts (*.dex)
	- you can check the integrity of the scripts by double-clicking Pictures.md5

Using Filezilla or another FTP client program, copy the files to the DEX hardware:

	- the contents of xxxScripts replace the contents of ASW\scripts
	- the contents of xxxPictures replace the contents of ASW\scripts\pictures

Examine the contents of ASW.ini and verify the following configuration parameters:

	- SlipCoPThresholdGripForce = 0.25

  NB: If this is not the case, edit ASW.ini to the settings as above and 
      inform J. McIntyre and Qinetiq about the discrepency.

GripGround Release (2014.07.10 18.56.05) installed on EM at EAC for training

	Restructured Subjects and Sessions for ground models:

		- Subject 'Training DEMO' has two sessions 'Seated Demo' and 'Supine Demo'. 
		  Each contains one repetition of each of the tasks.
		  Data tests are suppressed so as to minimize chances of alerts occuring during demos.
		  PIN code: 000

		- Subjects 'Training S', 'Training M' and 'Trainin L' are to be used during training sessions.
		  Sessions are organized as in flight, with protocols 'Dynamics', 'Reference Seated' and 'Reference Supine'.
		  PIN codes:  S - 123, M - 456, L - 789
		  Within each session, all the tasks are represented in the same order as for flight, 
		  except that the number of repetitions of each task has been reduced.
		  Tests of subject performance are the same as for flight, allowing for training on possible alert messages.

		- Subject labels in the login menu have been changed to BDC Subject 1, BDC Subject 2, etc. 
		  Subject IDs are the same as for the flight releases, as are the PIN codes.
		  These sessions should not be used for training.
